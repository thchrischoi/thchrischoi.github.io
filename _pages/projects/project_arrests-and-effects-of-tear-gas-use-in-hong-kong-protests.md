*Dec 2019*


Hong Kong has seen ongoing weekly protests since March 15. The protests began as a response against a proposed extradition bill, which would have allowed the extradition of fugitives from Hong Kong to mainland China and Taiwan. With little trust towards China's legal structure, many Hong Kongers felt that it was highly inappropriate, and possibly dangerous to have such a system in place. In addition, the protests were also fueled by the frustration of Hong Kongers towards the government's poor representation of the people, especially with the prominence of pro-China key figures in politics and the lack of universal suffrage.

The police responded to the protests, the majority of which were peaceful, with what many believed was an excessive use of force. The use of tear gas grenades, rubber bullets, and batons against largely peaceful protestors was shocking to the general public. Moreover, the police's usage of the "rioting" charge against protestors, a loosely defined law that has been unchanged since the 1967 riots and carries a maximum 10 year sentence, felt extremely disproportionate to use against the largely peaceful protests (Purbrick. M, 2019).
