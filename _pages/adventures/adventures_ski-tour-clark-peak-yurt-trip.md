### Day 1
* Vert:
* Mileage:

We arrived at the hut with our sled and far too much gear. It was about two miles to get there with around 600 feet vert. Pulling a sled was interesting. It was mostly smooth sailing but

THis was a long long hike. Cleaned up yurt and stashed our sled with gear somewhere Beautiful landscapes going up the valley towards the lake. we were really beat by then but glad we got to the top. A few nice turns on the way down of the skier's left side of the South Fork Canadian river

WE headed out and got some sunny blue skies to skin out with. beautiful veiw of the nokhu crags and seven ute's, which we skied last week, from the trail

### Skiing My First Couloir
I arrived to the top of the couloir at midday, where Miles and Clayton had been waiting for my weezing ass. We transitioned and dropped in. The main thing to look out for in this couloir is the cornice that hangs out on the skier's right of the entrance. Sticking to the skier's left of the run, there are a couple of pull of points that are shielded from slides. Lower down there's another pulloff skier's right. The morning sun had warmed this south facing couloir and we found perfect corn on the way down.

The ski out down the Tyndall Gorge was icy but gorgeous (pun intended). Miles and Clayton also boot packed up and skied down Hallet North Couloir, right above Emerald Lake. I hung out at the bottom and messed around with my ice axe and crampons.
