### Out of Breath

Four days before the trip, I started coming down with a bad cough. Tash, my partner, tells me that I was getting bronchitis. I didn't saw a doctor, but it sure felt like bronchitis. This would become a battle between my lungs and my determination to ski this line.

The prescription was to essentially spend three days in bed and praying that that'd be enough time to get back in shape.

### Get Up and Go

Like Yasuo in Yukio Mishima's "The Sound of Waves", I mustered all my "get up and go" at 4am on Sunday and convinced myself that I was good to go.

We started hiking from Bear Lake after picking up Calyton in Estes Park at around 7am. I soon realised that I was operating on about half a lung. The hike up to Flat Top mountain where Corral Couloir started from was slow and tortuous. I alternated between taking cough suppressants and magical yellow fever reducing pills from Japan every two hours.

### Skiing My First Couloir
I arrived at midday, where Miles and Clayton had been waiting for my weezing ass. We transitioned and dropped in. The main thing to look out for in this couloir is the cornice that hangs out on the skier's right of the entrance. Sticking to the skier's left of the run, there are a couple of pull of points that are shielded from slides. Lower down there's another pulloff skier's right. The morning sun had warmed this south facing couloir and we found perfect corn on the way down.

The ski out down the Tyndall Gorge was icy but gorgeous (pun intended). Miles and Clayton also boot packed up and skied down Hallet North Couloir, right above Emerald Lake. I hung out at the bottom and messed around with my ice axe and crampons.
