### Out of Breath

Four days before the trip, I started coming down with a bad cough. Tash, my partner, tells me that I was getting bronchitis. I didn't saw a doctor, but it sure felt like bronchitis. This would become a battle between my lungs and my determination to ski this line.

The presciption was to essentially spend three days in bed.

### Get Up and Go

Like Yasuo in Yukio Mishima's "The Sound of Waves", I mustered all my "get up and go" at 4am on Sunday and convinced Miles that I was good to go.

We started hiking from Bear Lake after picking up Calyton in Estes Park at around 7am. I soon realised that I was operating on about half a lung. The hike up to Flat Top mountain where Corral Couloir started from was slow and tortuous. I alternated between taking cough suppressants and magical yellow fever reducing pills from Japan every two hours.

### Mt.Mahler
We were soon climbing up the west face of Mt.Mahler. You could get a great view of Seven Utes from Mt.Mahler, which helped with our planning afterwards. We ended up transitioning about two thirds of the way up Mt.Mahler, where it started getting thin and icy. Sweet big open face to carve down and get some nice shallow pow turns in.

### Seven Utes

The climb from the saddle between Seven Utes and Mt.Mahler looked much harder and further than it actually was. We summmited and ate lunch before skating along the top ridge. The views were incredible. The ski out however, was through some dense trees and was fairly rough until we found old loggin paths to follow. Next time, we'd probably want to drop down off the east face and follow the way we skinned up back down the valley. At the end of the day, it was some great exploration.
